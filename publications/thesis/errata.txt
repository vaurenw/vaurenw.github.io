Eric Lawrence (http://www.ericlawrence.com/), formerly of Microsoft, has
provided this feedback via Twitter. Even though it hasn't been fully reviewed at
this point, it might be of some benefit to the critical reader:

Page 38: the URL appears to be "about:permissions" not "about:permission"
Page 38: GeoLocation has been supported since IE9.
Page 36 is confusing. No, IPs aren't checked. For thoughts on "hosting at the
 TLD", see http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2009/09/19/private-domain-names-and-public-suffixes-in-internet-explorer.aspx

This feedback has been provided by Mario Heiderich (http://heideri.ch/):

Section on P3P seems to imply it only applies to IE6. It's still in IE10, and
 was (buggily) in Firefox for years.
Content on Zones (page 20) appears to be a misunderstanding. Zones are
 Origin-derived & LIZ does not bypass SOP.
