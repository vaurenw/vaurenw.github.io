  <h1>What is mixed content?</h1>

    <p>In web security, you may have heard of "mixed content". Maybe you saw a
DevTools message like this one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mixed Content: Upgrading insecure display request ‘http://...’ to use ‘https’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This blog post is going to explain what "mixed content" means, its implications
for your website and how to handle mixed content.</p>
<h1>Mixed Content: active or passive?</h1>
<p>When hosting a web page on secure HTTPS, as it should be the default nowadays,
the term "mixed content" refers to content on your web page that is <em>not</em> using
HTTPS. Typical examples are images in <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags, stylesheets or scripts which
still point to URLs starting with <code>http://</code>.
Ideally, a website that supports HTTPS should ensure that all its content is
also secured with HTTPS. Otherwise, the protection against network attackers
that it gained with HTTPS could be compromised:</p>
<p>When the browser visits a web
page that uses mixed content, a passive network attacker can gain information
about the user's browsing behavior because of those unprotected mixed content
URLs in the web page. Furthermore, an active network attacker could replace or
modify the mixed content and therefore attack the whole home page.</p>
<p>Browsers have long since included protection against the harms of mixed
content. Already in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-mixed-content-20140722/">July 2014, a first working draft came out in the W3C
web application security working
group</a>,
that suggested browsers should block so-called <em>active</em> mixed content.
Originally, this referred to <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> elements, ensuring
that a network attacker can not modify or inject scripts into a victim page.
Other content, so-called <em>passive</em> mixed content (e.g., images)
were still allowed. The goal of this change, back then, was to prevent the
attack from active network attackers but still
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#support-existing-content">supporting existing content</a>,
which still used a <em>lot</em> of HTTP. As such, the active attacks were thwarted,
but passive attackers were still be able to infer browsing behavior through
network sniffing.</p>
<p>From then on, all new HTML elements and features, like responsive images in
<code>&lt;picture&gt;</code>, elements were all considered "active" elements and supposed
to be blocked.</p>
<h1>Upgrade Insecure Requests</h1>
<p>Right after that, the webappsec working group developed a new directive for
Content-Security-Policy (CSP) headers. Web pages that want their mixed
content to be secure can supply a response header of
<code>Content-Security-Policy: 'upgrade-insecure-requests'</code> and the browser will
implicitly rewrite <em>all</em> HTTP URLs into HTTPS. This includes <em>passive</em> and
<em>active</em> mixed content. Hyperlinks with an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>, are also rewritten but only
when they refer to the
<a href="https://frederikbraun.de/origins-sites-and-other-terminologies.html">same-origin</a>.
But again, this upgrading is all opt-in.</p>
<h1>Mixed Content: <em>upgradable</em> and <em>blockable</em></h1>
<p>Then, in year 2020, the engineers in the Chrome browser's network security
group did a thorough study to learn more about mixed content that is
still to be observed across the web.</p>
<p>The outcome was an even newer, improved <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/mixed-content/">Mixed
Content</a> standard. So that now, as of 2024,
most browsers no longer distinguish between "active" and "passive" mixed content.</p>
<p>From now on, all browsers will instead distinguish between <em>blockable</em> and
<em>upgradable</em> mixed content. Where the former includes HTML elements that have
already been blocked (e.g., like <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>), and we assume we
can't start loading lest sites break again. The latter is the passive content
that we have previously loaded insecurely.</p>
<p><strong>In essence, web pages that are hosted on HTTPS and contain image, audio or
video elements pointing to HTTP will receive an automatic, implicit upgrade.</strong>
Browsers will still not upgrade <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements that point to same- or cross-
origin URLs.</p>
<p>This is true for the browsers Firefox 127, Chrome 86, and Safari 18 (currently
in Tech Preview and expected to be released in the fall of 2024) or newer.</p>
<p>Now, with that changed in the Mixed Content standard, if you want your
same-origin URLs to be redirected, you can use an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security">HTTPS
<code>Strict_Transport-Security</code> header</a>.
You can still set a <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> with
<code>'upgrade-insecure-requests'</code> to upgrade all, the <em>blockable</em>, the <em>upgradable</em>
content and the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements.</p>
<p><small>This blog post was written as a counterpart to our release announcement
blog post at <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2024/06/05/firefox-will-upgrade-more-mixed-content-in-version-127/">"Firefox will upgrade more Mixed Content in Version 127" at the
Mozilla Security blog</a>.</small></p>
