# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

This Pelican blog is configured to deploy automatically to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository settings on GitHub
2. Navigate to "Pages" in the left sidebar
3. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
4. Choose the `gh-pages` branch and `/ (root)` folder
5. Click "Save"

### 2. Configure Repository Settings
1. In repository settings, go to "Actions" â†’ "General"
2. Under "Workflow permissions", select "Read and write permissions"
3. Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
4. Click "Save"

### 3. Push Your Changes
The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
- Build your Pelican site when you push to the `main` branch
- Deploy the built site to the `gh-pages` branch
- Make your site available at `https://vaurenw.github.io`

## Manual Deployment

If you need to deploy manually:

```bash
# Build the site
make publish

# The output will be in the `output/` directory
# You can then manually push this to the gh-pages branch
```

## Configuration

- **Site URL**: Set to `https://vaurenw.github.io` in `publishconf.py`
- **Build Output**: Generated in `output/` directory
- **GitHub Actions**: Configured in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

## Troubleshooting

- If the site doesn't appear, check the GitHub Actions tab for build errors
- Ensure the `gh-pages` branch is created and contains the built site
- Verify that GitHub Pages is enabled and pointing to the correct branch
